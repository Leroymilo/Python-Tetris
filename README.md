# Python-Tetris
A Tetris game I coded in Python

You can download the zip, uncompress it, and run the "Game.py" file, it just needs python3, numpy, random and pygame installed.

Use arrow keys to move the piece, a and d to rotate it and h to "hold" (storage) (all of these keys on a qwerty english keyboard).

I tried to mimic the behavior of the pieces from the original game as close as I could.

Don't mind the French in the script, I'm just to lazy to translate all of the comments.
